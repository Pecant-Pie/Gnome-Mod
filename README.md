# Cult of the Gnome | Mod for Minecraft 1.19.2 
A mod for minecraft that adds Gnome Cults! 

## Current Features

- 3D Gnome Statue and Offering Altar
- Gnome hat (item)
- Recipes for all items/blocks.
- Gnomes that you can spawn by using a Gnome hat on the statue block (this makes you take 1 heart of magic damage).
- Gnomes mine nearby ores and drop the items off in a nearby altar, dropping them above if it's full.
- Gnomes are bound to their statue, and breaking the statue will kill all bound gnomes.
- Each Statue may have a maximum of 5 gnomes bound to it at once. If a gnome dies, another may be spawned at the altar in its place.
- Gnomes get double the drops from mining ores. Note that this is fewer drops (on average) than mining with a Fortune III pickaxe.

## Planned Features for Next Update

- Port to Minecraft 1.20
- Balance changes (how far gnomes can search for ores and whatnot)

## Ideas for Further Development

- Randomized names for the gnomes.
- Three distinct statues that each spawn a unique type of gnome: Miner, Farmer, Logger.
- Unique appearances for the different types of gnomes.
- Mining gnome revamp that makes them more useful as a stationary cult.
- Faith system, where you can build certain structures or bestow gifts upon your gnomes to increase their productivity.
- Animations for praying at the statue or altar would be nice.
- A type of gnome that is loyal to you, not a statue, and can be directed to attack mobs or players.
- Interactions between different types of gnomes if their cults are close enough.
