# Cult of the Gnome | Mod for Minecraft 1.19.2 
A mod for minecraft that adds Gnome Cults! 
(they're not really cults, I just like the name)

## Current Features

- Gnome Statue and Offering Altar (blocks)
- Gnome hat (item)
- Gnomes that you can spawn by right clicking the statue block with a hat.
- The gnomes mine nearby ores and drop the items off at a nearby altar.
- Note: Gnomes are bound to their statue, and breaking the statue will kill all bound gnomes.
- Each Statue may have a maximum of 5 gnomes bound it at once. If a gnome dies, another may be spawned at the altar in its place.
## Planned Features for Initial Release

- Three distinct statues that each spawn a unique type of gnome: Miner, Farmer, Logger.
- Gnomes that do a task and then bring items from the completed task to the offering altar.
- Proper 3D assets for the statues and altar.
- Randomized names for the gnomes.
- Unique appearances for the different types of gnomes.

## Further Development

- Faith system, where you can build certain structures or bestow gifts upon your gnomes to increase their productivity.
- Animations for praying at the statue or altar would be nice.
- A type of gnome that is loyal to you, not a statue, and can be directed to attack mobs or players.
- Interactions between different types of gnomes if their cults are close enough.
